	<H2> <i> A Little Bit About Me! </i> </H2>
	<p> Hi, my name is Elizabeth Sheats. I'm 20 years old and was born in Atlanta, Georgia. I attend the University of Georgia where I study Advertising. In the past couple of years I have really developed a love for travel and the world around me. My parents have always encouraged me to be independent, which has brought an adventurous side out in me. From small lake trips with my family to massive 30 day tours through Europe solo, I have found how valuble travel is. Here are three of my favorite cities that have inspired me and helped me grow. Here's a link to my travel inspiration Pinterest Board: <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/eesheats/going-places/">Going Places Pinterest Board</a> </p>
	<H2> <i> Paris </i> </H2>
	<p> In June of 2017, I took a trip to Europe and travelled to 12 different cities in 30 days. It was the best month of my life. One place that really was special to me was Paris, France. Paris is a huge city that I was scared to venture through because of it's size. I thought I'd be extremely overwhelmed but found myself loving it and not being overwhelmed at all. The landmarks were breathtaking, the weather was perfect, and the people that I met all brought a new perspective of the city. </p> 
	<H2> <i> Wartrace </i> </H2>
	<p> Wartrace is a tiny town in Tennessee that is known for it's rolling hills and beautiful horse farms. Many wouldn't see much meaning in Wartrace but for me, Wartrace is a place that reminds me of how great it is to occasionally unplug. There isn't much cell service here, so I find my self enjoying the awesome scenery, going on long sunset walks, and occasionally cracking open a book. </p>
    <H2> <i> Atlanta </i> </H2>
	<p> Home is where the heart is. Atlanta has been a part of my life since I was born. Something about the familiar streets makes Atlanta one of my favorite places. Atlanta has the best resturants, shopping, parks, etc. I love being able to call Atlanta my home. </p>
